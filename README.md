This is a time series classification problem.
Here, I demonstrated how to use tsfresh for time series data feature extraction, and use different machine learning methods based on the extracted features. 

I also used a 1D CNN + LSTM on the raw time series data without additonal steps in feature extracton. 

Both methods have similar performance.
